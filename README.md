**Bank Customer Churn Prediction Project**

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses, as it helps them identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain customers.

**Project Components:**
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - The project starts with loading the dataset from a CSV file named "train.csv". The dataset contains various features related to bank customers.
   - Two columns, "CustomerId" and "Surname", are dropped from the dataset as they are not relevant for the predictive modeling.
   - The data is then shuffled using the `sample(frac=1)` function to ensure randomness in the dataset.
   - Next, the data is split into features (X) and the target variable (y), where X contains all features except the target variable "Exited", and y contains the "Exited" column.
   - The dataset is further split into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split ratio with a random seed of 125 for reproducibility.

2. **Feature Engineering and Preprocessing:**
   - Numerical features are scaled using Min-Max scaling and imputed using the mean strategy.
   - Categorical features are encoded using ordinal encoding and imputed using the most frequent strategy.
   - This preprocessing is implemented using `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` from Scikit-learn.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Selecting the best features is crucial for improving model performance and reducing overfitting.
   - The Chi-square (chi2) statistical test is applied to select the k-best features. In this project, all features are considered (k="all").

4. **Model Building:**
   - A Random Forest Classifier is chosen as the predictive model due to its effectiveness in handling complex datasets and its ability to capture feature importance.
   - The Random Forest model is instantiated with 100 estimators and a random state of 125 for reproducibility.

5. **Pipeline Creation:**
   - Pipelines are constructed to streamline the workflow, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.
   - Two pipelines are created: one for preprocessing and one for the combined feature selection and model training.

6. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - The complete pipeline is fitted to the training data, which includes preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.
   - The model's accuracy is evaluated using the testing dataset.
